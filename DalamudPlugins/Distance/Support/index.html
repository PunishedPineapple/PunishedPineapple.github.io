		<h1>Enemy Aggro Distances</h1>
		<h2>General Information</h2>
		<p>These distances are from the center of the player to the edge of the boss's hitring.  They should be considered to have +0y, -0.1y accuracy, as the game seems to have a small, but consistent amount of inaccuracy.  The vast majority of the time, the boss will actually aggro at ~0.03y closer than the distance shown here, although for some bosses, I have seen as low as 0.09y.</p>
		<p>This data does not include cone angles for sight-based enemies.  Data was intended for use with primarily bosses, of which all known aggro by proximity, or possibly by true sight with a very wide cone (this would explain anomalies like the e8s blind spot).
		<p>One last thing to note: An enemy with a given name ID seems to <em>usually</em> have the same aggro distance across territories, but there is at least one case where this does not hold true (ADS in t1 and t2), so it cannot be assumed.
